#Mt. Hood!

The Timberline Trail is a loop that wraps around the Mt. Hood tree line. It's 40 miles in length with amazing forest, meadow and glacier views. Camping takes place off the side of the trail, though you will find spots which are already cleared for a tent and firepit. No climbing experience or equipment is necessary. The trail begins and ends at the Timberline Lodge, a comfortable rustic place with warm fires, great food and drink.

## Dates

TBD (Aug - Oct)

There's the opportunity to hike the entire 40 mile Timberline Trail over the course of four or five days. Or, Hike in for a couple miles from one of the side trails. Or just meet the hikers at the lodge afterwards for dinner and beer!

The trail is not especially crowded, though it's best to avoid popular holidays such as labor day.
