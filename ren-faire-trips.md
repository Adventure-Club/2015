####**IMPORTANT**
**Please consider the following event constraints:**   
* Costumes are required _(by me, not the festivals - they are far less tyrannical than I am)_ 
    * no specificity regarding _what_ costumes, but you should make an attempt to keep a logical continuity 
        * i.e. I'm Spock, a time traveler from the future researching early human history, 
        * or, I am a villager out to buy some bread and flirt with the cute knights/wenches, etc.
    * I can loan costumes (male & female of a fairly wide variety) for Ren Fairs or you can rent when you get there
        * I am planning to rent for the Camlann festivals since I only have Renaissance period garb - not medieval
* Plan on a full day minimum - most are a long drive so we often try to stay the weekend (you are - obviously - free to come and go if you have your own ride)

###Logistics
_this will be updates as plans develope_

**June 6/27** - Camlann (tentative - if I have a buddy) <http://www.camlann.org/midsomer%20festival.htm> 
* tentative - waiting to see if I find someone to go with
* this would be about a 3-4 hr drive north 
* & I am planning to rent a costume once I get there because I don't own any medieval costumes
* They do a _seriously amazing_ 5 or 6-course meal with historically accurate dishes, utinsels (no forks), seating, and entertainment - it is pretty much a real courtly feast (cost: $45) - I am flexible on whether we do this but it is kinda the best part

**July 7/25** - Canturbury Ren Fair  
* tentative - waiting to see if I find someone to go with
* this would be about a 1.5 hr drive south to just outside Salem
* this would be the most likely candidate for a one-day trip 

**August 8/1** - WA Midsummer Ren Faire 
* Definitely going: This is the **Best Ren Fair** I have been to on the West Coast!! Plan to stay for the after party (no, seriously, you get to go to the afterparty in costume!!! How cool is that??)
* This is always a 2-day event - we get a cheap hotel neaby to make getting ready easier
* First weekend is Pirates, second weekend is Fairies (these are the best two)

**August 8/22** - Camlann Harvest Festival <http://www.camlann.org/harvest%20festival.htm> 
* This is my Birthday weekend
* I am planning to be there the whole weekend and do the feast!!  (cost: $45)
    * (FYI) They do a _seriously amazing_ 5 or 6-course meal with historically accurate dishes, utinsels (no forks), seating, and entertainment - it is pretty much a real courtly feast

**September 9/12 - 9/13** - Shrewsbury Ren Faire
* This is a pretty small, but surprisingly fun and well organized event
* Since it is a 3-hour drive south, it will probably be a full weekend ... not totally sure yet
* It is only 1 weekend long and I missed it last year so I'm really hoping this one will work out
