# Stub Stewart Camping!

Driving - Chuck and Erica, Josh and Andrea

Biking - Marc (?)

We have walk-to site 21 and 22 on the Brooke Creek camp. It's a 5 minute walk from the parking lot, but should be more secluded than the drive-in spots! Park by the visitors center, there are carts to carry camp gear if needed. There are pit toilets and water by the campsite, and nicer toilets + showers up by the visitor's center. The campfire area is shared between a few different sites.

There are hikes, a long bike trail and a nice area for stargazing and night photography.
